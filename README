This script converts a standard CSV export from the Anobii website to a format you should be able to import into Goodreads.

I have not written this script myself but just adapted it a bit so it works again. I've put it on Github since i think it might prove useful to more people than just me. 

You'll find the original by Giacomo Lacava here:
